Everything is A.O.K. (yep)
Because I'm strong as an O.A.K. (an oak)
But money don't grow on trees
And I'm B.R.O.K.E. (broke)

Everything is A.O.K. (yep)
Because I'm strong as an O.A.K. (an oak)
But money don't grow on trees
And I'm B.R.O.K.E. (I'm fuckin broke y'all)

Them rims, them rings, them things
You can bring 'em out.
I just had my debit card declined at IN'N'OUT.
The line is flippin' out, givin me evil eyes.
Fuck the soda,
Rerun it with just the cheesy fries.

Cause' I don't think money is THE devil.
I'm not sinkin' I'm just kickin' it at sea level.
I got my floaties on.
I'm focusing on all the wonderful stuff
With the force of obi wan
Kanobi bro, I'm broke.
Although I won't be woe-be-gone.
Cause' even though my bank account is low or overdrawn, I'm down to mow your lawn.

I'm getting open, I'm soakin up every moment
And so we should make a toast.
We won't be sober 'til the broke of dawn.

Because beer is cheap, and because love is free.
I'm buzzin',
Feelin' like every friend is a cousin g.
And someday we’ll be reminiscent
On some wasn’t we.
Just so down and out.
But we were happy then cause',

Everything is A.O.K. (yep)

Everything is A.O.K. (yep)
Because I'm strong as an O.A.K. (an oak)
But money don't grow on trees
And I'm B.R.O.K.E. (I'm hella broke bro)

Why should I sit on my ass on the couch
Be askin' why love isn't equal
With lesser possessions I'm light as a feather
And so I can fly like an eagle
Cause' everyone dies
And I wonder why leaders in power
Would lie to their people.

Be planning like they could be fitting a camel up into the eye of a needle.
But dammit id settle for fitting a
94' Camry inside of my driveway
I'm sick of the image,
I'm livin' my life, and I'm doin' it my way.
I'd rather be makin' the choices I'm proud of
Than chasing the mountain of money.

But if that mountain comes,
To me, I'm climbin' it.

Got a brick and I'm laying it down,
Gotta shovel, now I'm breakin' this ground.
Because I'm in the red
But it's only a color that I will be
Paintin' this town.
Because when I make it,
Then I dedicate it to the friends that stood with,
Who would do me favors.
Even lend me paper, when I couldn't pay for
A little take-out.

And to the fact,
That whatever you think that it means,
I'll be here and be livin' my dreams.
And it's cause of the people I leaned
On when I came apart at the seams.
So give me the moon, and give me the spoon,
I'm lickin' it clean
Until there just ain't nothing left
But who would lend a hand, cause

Everything's A.O.
Everything's A.O.

So when I say dey oh,
Say everything's A.O.

When I say dey oh,
You say everything's A.O.

When I say dey oh,
You say everything's A.O.
